## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
Here’s a summary of what powers ai-scribe-verse:  
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React (via Vite) + Tailwind CSS — for a fast, responsive UI.  
- **Backend**: (If applicable) Node.js with Express/Koa, or another server framework managing API routes, business logic, and authentication.  
- **Database**: (For document/project persistence) e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB or Supabase.  
- **AI / ML**: Python scripts/models (see `ml_model.py`) for generation logic, plus access to external APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc).  
- **Deployment & DevOps**: Vite config, bundlers/lock files, environment variables, etc, to support production and development builds.  
- **Other tooling**: Linting (ESLint), TypeScript configs, styling via Tailwind, etc.
